# Humilis

- based around early to mid progression, with some late game tools
- complete vanilla toolset and armorset
- add recipes for stone tools with all stone variants
- obsidian blocks have to be crushed and smelted to obsidian ingots in order to be used for tools
- gem tools (even diamond, has to be changed) need crushed gems combined with a binder in order to be used for tools and armor
- machines are based on water power
- crusher has a low chance of duplicating ores, can be upgraded by addding different blocks next to it
- special furnace that is a bit faster, can be even faster by adding a blower that is water powered, needs more coal though
- press can create plates (one ingot = one plate)
- unfired stuff crafted from clay that has to be burned
- in combination with sand?
